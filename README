# City Bike Data Insights Platform

## Overview

The **City Bike Data Insights Platform** for New York City (NYC) offers valuable insights into the cityâ€™s bike usage. By analyzing key metrics such as ride distances, durations, locations, and user behavior, this platform empowers stakeholders (e.g., bike rental companies, city planners, and local businesses) to make informed, data-driven decisions. The data processing is handled through Python, and the results are stored in a PostgreSQL database for easy integration with Power BI visualizations.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Python script, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database system used for storing and managing the bike data.
- **Python**: The programming language used to run the data processing script.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install PostgreSQL

Download and install PostgreSQL from the [official PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), following the installation instructions for your operating system.

### 2. Install Python

Ensure that Python (version 3.x or later) is installed on your system. You can download the latest version from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 3. Configure the Python Script

The provided Python script (`check_and_create_db.py`) will automatically create the database for you, but you will need to configure your database credentials.

- Open the Python script and modify the following variables to match your PostgreSQL setup:

  - `DB_USER`: Your PostgreSQL username.
  - `DB_PASSWORD`: Your PostgreSQL password.
  - `DB_HOST`: The host where PostgreSQL is running (typically `localhost`).
  - `DB_PORT`: The PostgreSQL port (usually `5432`).

### 4. Run the Script to Set Up the Database and Insert Data

After configuring your database credentials, run the Python script to automatically:

- Create the database.
- Set up the necessary tables.
- Insert the bike data into the database.

Once the script has completed, you can use Power BI to visualize and analyze the data.
